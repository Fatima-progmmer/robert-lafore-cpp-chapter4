# Robert Lafore C++ Chapter 4 – Program Solutions

This repository contains solutions to **all 10 programs from Exercise 4** of the book:  
📘 *"Object-Oriented Programming in C++"* by **Robert Lafore**.

## 📚 Programs Covered

| Program No. | Description                           |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Program 1   | Demonstrates basic `struct` usage      |
| Program 2   | Adds two distance values using `struct` |
| Program 3   | Uses `cin` and `cout` with structures  |
| Program 4   | Manipulates multiple structure variables |
| Program 5   | Uses `enum` for day-of-week handling   |
| Program 6   | Adds two time values using structures  |
| Program 7   | Demonstrates floating-point structure usage |
| Program 8   | Uses classes instead of structures     |
| Program 9   | Adds two distances using classes       |
| Program 10  | Time addition using class methods      |

> 📌 Each program reflects practical applications of **structures**, **enums**, and **basic class concepts**, setting a strong foundation for object-oriented thinking.
